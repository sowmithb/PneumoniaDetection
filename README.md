# Pneumonia Detection Using CNN

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The model is trained on a dataset containing normal and pneumonia-affected X-rays to classify images effectively.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation is sourced from the Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset available on Kaggle. It consists of:

Normal X-rays: Healthy lung images.

Pneumonia X-rays: Images showing signs of pneumonia.

## Features

Implemented using PyTorch and Resnet18.

Data preprocessing includes normalization and augmentation.

Model architecture: Convolutional layers, batch normalization, and ReLU activation functions.
